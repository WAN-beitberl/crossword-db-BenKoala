Analizing "playcrossword" usage of tables.
1. I would assume that the website uses a single table to store the following:

	"Puzzles"
	a. The index of each word(int).
	b. The question (or the mystery definition)(text).
	c. The answer(text).
	d. The index on the board of the first letter(int).
	e. The index on the board of the last letter(int).
	f. The crossword index(int).
	g. The direction of the writing - D for down, A for across (text).
In addition, i would use a table to store the following:
	"Board"
	a. The board index(int).
	b. The amount of puzzles(int).
	c. The size of the board (int).
In such way that a single table record would look like this:
	("Puzzles" example) 1.|Loafing|IDLE|0|3|8310|A
	("Board" example) 8310|55|13
The resoning behind using a table to store those specifing tpyes of information: 
	a. The table allows linked data to be organized together.
	b. The table allows common data (such as index and question,
	   for example) to be displayed together.
	c. The table allows the creation of relations between objects (for example,
	   the board index appears in both "Puzzles" and "Board".
2. I do not find any advanteges in using a table to resemble the following:
	a. The puzzle score.
	b. The blacked out squares in the board.
As neither of them can be broken down into serialized elements.

4. The commands I used while building the database:
	- sqlite3 CrossWord
	- CREATE TABLE
	- ALTER TABLE
	- JOINS
	- .tables
	- .schema
	- SELECT * FROM
	- INSERT INTO
	- .quit
